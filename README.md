Lab 3 for Bioviz

Interaction Opportunities Simulation Currently Supports:
Adjusting speed of generations.
	This allows the user to speed up or slow down the generations. This would allow the user to quickly get to the end or see the individual changes.
Adding more cells
	This allows the user to increase the number of cells that are on the screen.
Resetting to beginning
	This allows the user to reset to a random assortment of cells on the screen.
Pause simulation
	This allows the user to have a better understanding of what is currently happening in the simulation at a current point in time.
Clear simulation
	This allows the user to create a blank canvas for the user to add different cells too.

Interaction Opportunities Simulation Does Not Currently Support:
Adjust size of cells
	The user may want to adjust the size of cells used.
	Giving the user the ability to adjust the size of cells will allow
	I identified this by thinking of things I may have wanted to change while running the simulation.
Change colours used
	I identified this by thinking of things I may have wanted to change while running the simulation.
Show count of each type of cell
	I identified this by thinking of things I may want to know while running the simulation.
Show a line graph of cell population as time continues
	I identified this by thinking of things that may be interesting to visualize as the simulation runs.
